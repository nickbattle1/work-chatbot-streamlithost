# Streamlit-Hosted RAG AI Chatbot  

Zorro is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) AI chatbot designed for testing and fine-tuning chatbot interactions in a user-friendly Streamlit environment. This version includes both front-end and back-end functionality, making it an excellent tool for evaluating chatbot responses before integrating them into your official website frontend.  

## Key Features  

- **Language Model**: Utilizes Anthropic's Claude Haiku model for natural language processing and generation.  
- **Embedding Model**: Employs OpenAI's embedding model for creating high-dimensional vector representations of data.  
- **Data Parsing and Formatting**:  
    - Supports text-based data files such as JSON, CSV, Excel, Word, and PDF.  
    - Reformats files into a format compatible with the language model.  
- **Data Chunking and Storage**: Processes large datasets by chunking them and embedding the information into a vector database for efficient querying.  
- **Document Upload**: Streamlit app includes a dialogue box to upload your data files directly—no need to edit the code.  
- **Customizable Prompt**: The core prompt is located in the `rag_methods.py` file and can be easily modified to suit your business or application needs **before** deploying the app.  
- **API Key Management**: The app provides a dropdown section for entering your Anthropic and OpenAI API keys directly within the Streamlit interface.  

## Requirements
